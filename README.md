# 1.-Data-Analysis-Description

The purpse of this project is to display various skills common to data analysis. Each has been split up into different repositories as a means to keep everyting organized (and make it easier if anyone wants to jump into a specific section without having to search).

The objective is to quantify each score that has been awared on every series of Strictly Come Dancing to see if there is a statistical trend between when dances are typically performed during the season.
  1. Are certain dances given lower scores due to being performed earlier in the season (Cha-Cha, Salsa) when the average scores are lower?
  2. Do we have any issues with certain dances that are performed later in the series trending higher in averages?
  3. Does the statistically best celebrity end up winning the series?

The main language I will be conducting this in will be Python (with some SQL being used within the data analysis section)

The "timeline" of the repositories will be as follows:

1. Data Scraping - I will use Python to scrape the Wikipedia pages and then convert the data into both .csv and SQL
2. Data Cleaning - 
3. Statistical Analysis - I will conduct this in both Excel and SQL
4. Visual Analysis - I will conduct some visual analysis using Tableau Public

At the end of the project, I hope to have displayed the following skills:
- Data Scraping
- Data Cleaning
- Statistical Analysis
- Tableau
- Python
- SQL
