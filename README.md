# 1.-Data-Analysis-Description

The purpse of this project is to display various skills common to data analysis. Each has been split up into different repositories as a means to keep everyting organized (and make it easier if anyone wants to jump into a specific section without having to search).

The objective is to quantify each score that has been awared on every series of Strictly Come Dancing to see if there is a statistical trend between when dances are typically performed during the season.

I hypothesize that there will be a statistical reason of why some dances are performed earlier versus later (that goes beyond the technique of the dance. However, I aim to answer the following questions:
  1. Are certain dances given lower scores due to being performed earlier in the season (Cha-Cha, Salsa) when the average scores across the board will be        lower?
  2. Do we have any issues with certain dances that are performed later in the series trending higher in averages just generally due to a lower sample          size?
  3. Does the statistically best celebrity end up winning the series or is this purely a popularity contest disguised as a dancing compeition?

The main language I will be conducting this in will be Python

The "timeline" of the repositories will be as follows:

1. Data Scraping - I will use Python to scrape the Wikipedia pages and then convert the data into .csv
2. Data Cleaning - 
3. Statistical Analysis - I will conduct this in both Excel
4. Visual Analysis - I will conduct some visual analysis using Tableau Public

At the end of the project, I hope to have displayed the following skills:
- Data Scraping
- Data Cleaning
- Statistical Analysis
- Tableau
- Python

Something of note is that I have intentionally missed out the 2020 series (series 18) for 2 reasons. Due to Covid-19, the season was shortened by 4 weeks due to the cast being 12 instead of the usual 16. This meant that the number of dances performed by each constestant was shorted as well. However, the main issue is that there were only 3 judges (with a total maximum score of 30) compared to the usual score of 40 from 4 judges.
  As such, I made the decision to leave out this series purely because using the scores out of 30 would affect the precision of the data and normalizing     the scores out of 30 to scores out of 40 would affect the accuracy.
